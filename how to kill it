if you find him, you need to kill him, so follow this steps

1. you need to recognize what music he's playing, 
if he's playing run rabbit and you're tagger, you need to tag him
if he's tagged, go to step 2
if he's playing tonight you belong to me, follow him until he plays run rabbit
if he's playing daisy, run, otherwise you can get banned, but he can't ban you for no reason (more info about banning in banninginfo)

2. if you tag him successfully, you need to follow him to the nearest leaderboard and see who he points.
the player who has the nickname he pointed to, needs to find him and say this words

000 get out 23756

3. if you do all steps right, he should run to leaderboard in canions and point to player who "killed him", then he plays song with trumpets and he leaves the lobby

it is possible that he will be watching the code on which he was "killed" with a nickname "00Hrump00"

that's all
goodluck
